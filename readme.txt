Uses the title given to the shop page as the actual title instead of "Products."
 
== Description ==
 
By default, WooCommerce shows "Products" as the title of the "Shop" page, regardless of what that page's title actually is.  This simple plugin makes the shop page use the actual title of that page for the title instead of "Products."

There are no settings.  Just install and activate it and whatever the page's title is set to be will show up on your shop page.
 
== Installation ==
 
1. Upload the `wc-shop-title` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate *Shop Title = Page Title for WooCommerce* through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
